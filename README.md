# GitCloner
Just a simple Python script that clones specific GitHub Repos for you.

# A little bit about myself 
Well, nothing much to say here, I am 11 and I have a passion for programming.
Enough about me, now let's get on to the project.

# Installation: Linux
Currently the only platform this works on is linux based shells, so yeah.

1. Open up the terminal cntrl + alt + T or look it up in applications.
2. Type these commands:


```
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/XxTvanderb/GitCloner
$ cd GitCloner
$ python3 ./Main.py
```


3. If you don't have python, install it by using these commands:


```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

Enjoy!
